### Hi There! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

Iâ€™m [**Muskan**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhmuxkan/), an aspiring AI & design engineer based in India.  

I love blending logic with a touch of magicâ€”crafting things that arenâ€™t just functional, but also beautiful and thoughtful. From soft UIs to powerful AI, Iâ€™m always creating something that speaks both heart & code.

My goal? To build things that feel good to use, while being smart under the hood.

Outside the lines of code, Iâ€™m endlessly curious about the tech world. Whether itâ€™s testing the latest AI tools or sketching ideas for my next project, Iâ€™m always working on something fun (most of it hiding in private repos ðŸ‘€).  

I document my journey through clean, beginner-friendly tech blogsâ€”because learning should feel like a warm cup of coffee.

 ### Letâ€™s Connect

Iâ€™m always open to meaningful collaborations, exciting projects, or just thoughtful conversations about tech, design, and everything in between.

**Feel free to reach out**â€”whether itâ€™s about a project, a problem to solve, or just to say Hi ðŸ’Œ
